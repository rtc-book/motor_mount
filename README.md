### Installation Instructions

1. Place one hex nut into the hexagonal pocket inside the main bore.
2. Slide the motor into the main bore with the encoder pins pointed in the same directions as the three holes.
3. Thread the set screw into the center hole, but **do not tighten**.
4. Slide one hex nut into each of the side pockets.
5. Plug the encoder into its plug on the T1a electromechanical subsystem circuit board.
6. Slide the motor mount along the motor until the mounting holes line up with the holes in the circuit board.
7. Place a screw in each of the two outer holes and tighten.
8. Tighten the set screw accessible via the middle hole.
